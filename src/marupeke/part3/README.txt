Displaying the Data:

-The way I display data is that I use a GridPane and create the grid through that.
-I use a for loop in order to put the uneditable tiles and the editable tiles.
-Everything is made through the start method.




Editing the Data:
Every tile that is editable has a button on the tile.
- Left click to mark X
- Right click to mark O
- Middle click to unmark (it will be returned to "_"
- I have created mouse events that allow the user to do this that is inside the for loop
- If the tile is uneditable, nothing will happen if you click

Optional Extras:
The rules of the game are printed out before you start on the console.
You can also type your size when you begin the game.


Note:
You still have to run through the main's parameters in order to start the game, but you will also be prompted to put the size in
The SDK I have used is Project SDK 1.8
